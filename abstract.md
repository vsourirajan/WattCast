# WattCast: Energy Consumption Forecasting from Smart Meter Data

Accurately forecasting energy consumption is essential for efficient grid management, demand response optimization, and the integration of renewable energy sources. In this work, we introduce WattCast, a spatiotemporal forecasting pipeline that predicts future energy consumption at the low-voltage feeder level by leveraging both historical consumption data and the spatial relationships between feeders. We use the Weaver Energy Dataset, which provides half-hourly aggregated energy consumption data across a large proportion of the United Kingdom. This dataset reflects electricity demand at the low-voltage feeder level, aggregating smart meter readings while preserving privacy. Our approach represents feeders as nodes in a graph, where edges are defined based on both physical proximity and similarity in consumption profiles. To capture both spatial and temporal dependencies, we explore two distinct approaches. First, we investigate a modular framework that separates spatial and temporal learning, Second, we consider a unified Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN). Additionally, we integrate exogenous variables, such as weather and solar irradiance data, to enhance predictive accuracy. Through this comparative study, WattCast seeks to insights into effective model architectures for 
feeder-level energy forecasting, contributing to more informed decision-making in energy distribution and sustainability efforts.
