# WattCast: Energy Consumption Forecasting from Smart Meter Data

Accurately forecasting energy consumption is essential for efficient grid management, demand response optimization, and the integration of renewable energy sources. In this work, we present WattCast, a spatiotemporal forecasting framework designed to predict future energy consumption at the low-voltage feeder level. WattCast leverages the Weaver Energy Dataset, which provides half-hourly aggregated energy consumption data from the United Kingdom. Our approach augments the time series data with learned substation embeddings derived from a graph representation of substations, capturing spatial relationships based on their physical proximity and consumption patterns. We compare the performance of this hybrid model—combining LSTM with graph-augmented embeddings—against an LSTM without graph augmentation and several baseline models, including SARIMA, Prophet, and other naive approaches. The hybrid model achieves a mean \( R^2 = 0.72 \), the highest among all models evaluated, offering a robust solution for accurate feeder-level energy forecasting and highlighting the benefits of hybrid spatiotemporal modeling.
