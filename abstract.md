# WattCast: Energy Consumption Forecasting from Smart Meter Data

Accurately forecasting energy consumption is essential for efficient grid management, demand response optimization, and the integration of renewable energy sources. In this work, we introduce WattCast, a spatiotemporal forecasting model that predicts future energy consumption at the low-voltage feeder level by leveraging both historical consumption data and the spatial relationships between feeders. We use the Weaver Energy Dataset, which provides half-hourly aggregated energy consumption data for February across a large proportion of the UK. This dataset reflects electricity demand at the low-voltage feeder level, aggregating smart meter readings while preserving privacy. Our approach represents feeders as nodes in a graph, where edges are defined based on both physical proximity and similarity in consumption profiles. To capture both spatial and temporal dependencies, we design a pipeline where a Graph Neural Network (GNN) learns node embeddings that encode feeder interactions, which are then fed into a temporal model to learn sequential patterns in energy demand. Additionally, we incorporate exogenous variables, such as weather and solar irradiance data, to enhance predictive accuracy. By integrating spatial and temporal dependencies through a hybrid model, WattCast aims to improve the accuracy of feeder-level energy forecasting, contributing to more informed decision-making in energy distribution and sustainability efforts.
