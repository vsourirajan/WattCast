# WattCast: Spatiotemporal Energy Consumption Forecasting

## Project Overview
WattCast is a hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting model designed to predict energy consumption at the substation level. It combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for spatial modeling, effectively capturing both the temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies between interconnected substations.
